## Description

I was tasked with refactoring the codebase for Horiseon, a fictional marketing agency. 

### Acceptance Criteria

* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

The client has requested a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT the website is optimized for search engines

### Work Completed

* Optimised the website name
* Fixed broken code that made some navigational links not function properly
* Refactored HTML to make it accessible for screen readers and follows the semantic best practices
* Consolidated redundant CSS selectors and properties
* Added alt attributes to images to improve SEO
* Added further improvements for long-term sustenability
*
